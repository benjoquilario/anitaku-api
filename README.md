# <p align="center">ANITAKU API</p>

<div align="center">
Another anitaku API serving anime information from anitaku website
</div>

> [!IMPORTANT]
>
> 1. This API is just an unofficial api for [anitaku](https://anitaku.pe) and is in no other way officially related to the same.
> 2. The content that this api provides is not mine, nor is it hosted by me. These belong to their respective owners. This api just demonstrates how to build an api that scrapes websites and uses their content.
> 3. This repo is almost the same of Consumet and Aniwatch API, I just added some feature like AZ-List, new seasons, completed anime, requested, upcoming and related anime from gogoanime. Read the documentation for more informations.

#### Acknowledgement

Credits to this two repo for scraping logic. I learned how to scrape site.
